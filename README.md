## What to Bring?
Your Laptop. Data will be made available in the cloud. We'll be using Colab Notebooks, and everything can be done in the cloud. If you prefer, you can also use your local machine.

## What are we looking for in the mentors?
As the participants are students, we're not necessarily expecting them to take the lead in their teams. Therefore, you - the mentors - should be the ones planning, leading, and executing the projects. You'll have to get your hands dirty! The workshops and challenges will mostly require AI / Data Science skills and clinical knowledge; mentors in each team will these to the table! In a nutshell, we want mentors to bring their unique perspectives, experience and critical thinking to the table! We're sure you'll do a great job if you understand and appreciate Health Equity and Patient Safety.

## How to Guide the Teams in each Workshop?
to-do!
